# SemanticTowers
A neuro-symbolic workflow leveraging semantic primes and universals to enhance a Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) pipeline

This is the official code repository for the paper: ["DSTI at LLMs4OL 2024 Task A: Intrinsic versus extrinsic knowledge for type classification"](https://hal.science/hal-04678365).
